Search Hero replaces the default search with a better search that sorts by relevance.  Designed for fast performance, and large wordpress sites.

== Description ==

Search Hero replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine. You'll get faster more relevant results, and your users will thank you.

Your wordpress content will need to be indexed after plugin installation.  Once the content is indexed, new and updated content will be kept up to date automatically.

The index process can be done from the plugin settings page, and also using wp-cli on the command line.

For large sites with many posts, using wp-cli is recommended.  The command to index is `wp-cli search-hero index`
